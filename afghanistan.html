                    According to Worldometers, the current population of Afghanistan is 43,058,131 as of November, 2024. The below Bivariant choropleth map is made from another dataset that shows the total population and population by gender for each provice. <br>
                    The Bivariant* Choropleth map and table give a detailed view of population distribution by gender across Afghanistan's provinces, with visual emphasis on areas with higher and lower populations. The information on this map can help understand population density and gender distribution in different parts of the country. <br><br>
